                <h2 class="emphasize">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p>- This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river<br>
                    trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.<br>
                    <br>
                    - Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with<br>
                    breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience.<br>
                    The canyon is filled not only with whitewater rapids, but with side canyons<br>
                    and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.<br>
                    <br>
                    - CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids<br>
                    in the Canyon technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide<br>
                    variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with<br>
                    the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.<br>

                <h2 class="emphasize">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                <p>- Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate<br>
                    land anywhere, the Green river towards the mighty Colorado river and the<br>
                    sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and rapids have made<br>
                    this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys<br>
                    Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery,<br>
                    interesting geologic formations, of prehistoric and historic human activity,<br>
                    and great whitewater opportunities.<br>

                    <br>- Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days<br>
                    
                    <br>- Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This<br>
                    designation is based on the uniqueness rich history that the canyon tells.<br>

                <h2 class="emphasize">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p>- Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the<br>
                    nickname ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came<br>
                    to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.<br>

                    <br>- Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly<br>
                    sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the<br>
                    campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.<br>
                    
                    <br>- Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the<br>
                    United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower,<br>
                    and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend<br>
                    to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.<br>
