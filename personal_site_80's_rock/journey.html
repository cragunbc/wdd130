        Who is Journey?
        Journey was a band that was formally made in 1973 in San Francisco, California, but rose to the top 
        during the 1980’s with a number of their electric songs. During their rise to the top their band consisted
        of 5 band members: Steve Perry (Vocal), Neal Schon (Guitar), Jonathan Cain (Piano), Steve Smith (Drums), 
        and Ross Valory (Bass Guitar). Neal Schon who is the only founding member left of the band dropped out of 
        High School and joined a band called Santana. They eventually broke off from Santana and made their own 
        sound and music and called it Journey

                    What made Journey Successful?
                    The most recognizable features of Journey were their guitar solos and their vocals. Steve Perry who formally 
                    has been giving the nickname “The Voice” was one of the driving forces that propelled them to many sold out 
                    stadiums and countless hits. Partnering that with Neal Schon’s guitar skills and it was a recipe for success. 
                    A lot of their success came from 2 of the albums that the released in the 80’s in Escape and Frontiers. These 
                    2 albums were headlined by their top 2 best songs ever written in Don’t Stop Believin’ and Faithfully. Their 
                    album Escape became #1 in the nation after its release. They have since been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
