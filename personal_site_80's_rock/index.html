        What made 80’s rock different?
        Unlike prior music eras the 1980’s brought a different sound. It was a harder sound that relied 
        heavier on the guitar. It introduces the “Power Ballad” which consisted of heavy drumming and 
        recognizable guitar solos. Along with the power ballad becoming more widely used the progression 
        of technology increased. Sound systems and synthesizers were cheaper to make and were able to be 
        carried around easier from place to place making the music have a stronger foothold with its listeners.

        Why is 80’s Rock still popular today?
        In a large way the music that was made in the 1980’s relayed a message to people’s personal lives. 
        They connected with it and still care those feelings and messages with them today. A lot of movies 
        and shows that have come out in recent years have used 80’s music or cared the same vibe that was 
        present in the 1980’s. Those shows and movies reconnect a growing generation of people to their past 
        and exposing a new generation to previously widely loved music.
