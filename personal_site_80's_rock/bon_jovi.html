        Who is Bon Jovi?
        Bon Jovi was a band that was formed in 1983 in Sayreville, New Jersey. During their rise to the top, they were 
        composed of the following band members: Bon Jovi (Vocals), Richie Sambora (Guitar), Alec John Such (Bass), 
        David Bryan (Keyboards), and Tico Torres (Drums). They were a local group of artists that grew up in the Sayreville area. 
        When one of Jon’s solo songs “Runaway” hit the radio for the first time it took off, and with it came the formal formation of the band.

        What made Bon Jovi Successful?
        When it comes to commercial success, they rose to the top with over 100 million albums sold helping form some of the most 
        noticeable songs ever. Just a few years after their formation they released an album called Slippery When Wet and it was headlined 
        by their most recognizable song in Livin’ on a Prayer. They followed other bands when it came to visual effects and lighting on 
        stage that helped capture the attention of the audience and sell out multiple stadiums. They have since been inducted into the Hall of Fame.
