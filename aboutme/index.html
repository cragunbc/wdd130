    <p>Hey Everyone, I'm Brantley Cragun and I'm working on a degree
        in Software Development. I'm a huge sports fan and love to watch
        any sporting event that I can. I love 80's music and love to drive
        my motorcycle when the weather is nice outside. I've been a member
        of the church for my whole life and it's helped me become a better
        person as a result. I currently work for a security company.
    <p>One of my favorite quotes from this past General Conference was from
        President Nelson. He said "One of the easiest ways to identify a true
        follower of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats
        other people." I've seen that be true with various people that have
        come in and out of my life. I'm excited to learn with all of you this
        semester.
